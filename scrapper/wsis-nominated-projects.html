<p class="tl-justify">WSIS Project Prizes is an immediate response to the requests expressed by WSIS stakeholders during the WSIS Forum 2011: to create a mechanism to evaluate and reward stakeholders for their efforts in the implementation of WSIS outcomes. The WSIS Project Prizes are an integral part of the WSIS Stocktaking Process that was set up in 2004 (Para 120, Tunis Agenda).</p>
<p class="tl-justify">The WSIS Project Prizes 2015 contest provides the platform to identify and showcase the success stories and models that could be easily replicated, to empower the community at the local level, to give the chance to everyone to participate in the contest and mainly to recognize the efforts of stakeholders for their added value to society and commitment towards achieving WSIS goals.</p>
<p class="tl-justify">The contest of WSIS Project Prizes is open to all stakeholders: governments, private sector, civil society, international organizations, academia and others. The contest comprises 18 categories that are directly linked to the WSIS Action Lines outlined in the Geneva Plan of Action.</p>
