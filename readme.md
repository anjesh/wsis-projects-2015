WSIS Nominated Projects 2015 Scraper and Viewer
===============================================

I wanted to see the total number of nominated projects in the WSIS list. It would be interesting to see which country sees the highest number of projects. The website http://groups.itu.int/stocktaking/WSISProjectPrizes.aspx#nominated-projects doesn't list the projects properly, i can't see if my project is there, i can't see how many projects are nominated. Here are the scripts to get those data and then search them easily. Now you may use the data for your own purpose. 

[Run Scrapper](scrapper) and prepare the following [csv projects file](scrapper/wsis-projects-data.csv)

[View the data](viewer) using [Recline](http://okfnlabs.org/recline/)
