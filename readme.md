WSIS Nominated Projects 2015 Scraper and Viewer
===============================================

I wanted to see the total number of nominated projects in the WSIS list. It would be interesting to see which country sees the highest number of projects. Here's a quick js which you could run directly in the console and scrape all the required data. Then you could search the projects using free text. 

[Run Scrapper](scrapper/readme.md) and prepare the following [csv projects file](scrapper/wsis-projects-data.csv)

[View the data](viewer) using Recline
